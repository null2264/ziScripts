# ziScripts

Collection of scripts that I personally used.

## Scripts

- `dropbox`: Simple dropbox uploader, also able to share file and print the url using `-s` flag.
- `post-python-upgrade`: Python script that install packages installed on old python install to newer one.
- `template`: Simple template manager, create a template or copy a template to a destination.
- `todo`: Simple todo list.
